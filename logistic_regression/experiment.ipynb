    "# Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, you will be implementing a Logistic Regression model for binary classification (yes-or-no like predictions). This is a simple model with restricted application areas, but it is very useful when applied to appropriate problems. Moreover, for those of you interested in Deep Learning, many of the concepts covered here are fundamental to how most neural networks as built and optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should begin by implementing a standard form of logistic regression. That is, we want to predict a target variable $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ given observed feature variables $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, and their relationship is modeled as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- prediction $ = \\hat{y} = h_\\theta(x) = \\sigma(\\theta^T x) \\in (0, 1)$, where:\n",
    "    - $h_\\theta$ is your Logistic Regression model\n",
    "    - $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the parameters of the model\n",
    "    - $\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$ is the logistic function (`sigmoid` in the provided code)\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters $\\theta$ should be optimized with gradient descent on a loss derived from maximum likelihood estimation under the assumption that $P(y | x, \\theta)$ is Bernoulli distributed.\n",
    "Please refer to [Andrew Ng's lecture notes on supervised learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes2020spring/cs229-notes1.pdf) for more details. The most salient information for this problem can be found in Section 5, but we recommend that you read through all of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided some skeleton code for the classifier, along with a couple of utility functions in the [logistic_regression.py](./logistic_regression.py) module. Please fill out the functions marked with `TODO` and feel free to add extra constructor arguments as you see fit (just make sure the default constructor solves the first dataset)."
